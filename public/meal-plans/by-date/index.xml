      <description>Before The Week I went to the grocery store last Thursday so the fridge is pretty full. As we had a roasted chicken last week, we now have about a half-gallon of chicken broth I made on Saturday. Bought two chickens so still have one for a few meals this week plus additional broth to make.
During the Week Sunday: Made breadsticks with the standard recipe (yeast, flour, water salt) and I added some paprika to the dough which gave it some fun, streaky coloration.</description>
