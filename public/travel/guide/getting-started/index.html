    <p>This page is about preparing for your trip abroad, specifically focusing on the cooking and food experience you want to have when traveling.</p>
<h2 id="research-and-motivation">Research and Motivation</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to research before you leave but it can be helpful and motivating.</p>
<p>If you like to read about food culture, books can be useful during long flights/transportation. For example, &hellip;links to food books.</p>
<p>Use your tv/netflix/etc viewing habits to help motivate you and give you ideas about what to eat and where to go. I&rsquo;ll presume you watch some food-related or travel-related shows – use these to your advantage.</p>
<p>Online research is also helpful and you can find more targeted and specific information such as market locations and food-related events and classes. If food blogs are your thing, there is no shortage of food blogs, usually written by expats, that focus on food in particular locations. Want suggestions on where to get ramen in Tokyo? That exists. Want to know where the best gelato is in Italy? There are no shortage of opinions on that either.</p>
<p>These media can help you learn about foreign food culture, dishes, markets and specialty ingredients. They can help you get ideas about where and when to go and what to cook.</p>
<h2 id="apartment-and-location-selection">Apartment and Location Selection</h2>
<p>All other things being equal, situate yourself near a great market unless that puts you in a super touristy location that you&rsquo;d prefer to avoid. In Barcelona, for example, I picked an apartment right next to La Boqueria, a famous and beautiful market. Without that market, I&rsquo;d have stayed elsewhere as the area around there can be too loud and packed with tourists and the kind of people who prey on them. The riches of that market were worth the cost of being next to the main tourist thoroughfare.</p>
<p>When searching for an apartment online, pay attention to the kitchen. Don&rsquo;t expect it to be perfect but keep an eye out for kitchens that just won&rsquo;t work for you. If you see no photos of the kitchen in the online listing for the apartment, avoid it. If the kitchen has no counter space or looks like it was an afterthought crammed into a space that had no kitchen when originally built, you should probably avoid the apartment. The more you search for and rent apartments, the better you&rsquo;ll become at spotting the places that don&rsquo;t work for you after quickly viewing the apartment&rsquo;s photos online.</p>
<p>By the way that &ldquo;if they don&rsquo;t have photos of it, it&rsquo;s probably not acceptable&rdquo; rule also applies to the bedroom and bathroom. If a listing has no photos of these rooms, I avoid it.</p>
<p><em>Add photo of small but acceptable kitchen</em></p>
<h2 id="tools--packing">Tools &amp; Packing</h2>
<p>How you pack can have a huge impact on how much you enjoy your trip. I discuss those details from an overall traveling perspective elsewhere [link] but my suggestions can be simply summarized by saying do not pack more than you need. Lighter luggage is always better.</p>
<p>If you are taking a very long trip (several months or more), you may want to consider bringing a chef&rsquo;s knife and possibly some other helpful tools (a peeler, cheese grater, corkscrew/bottle opener). Rarely will you find suitable knives in rental apartments. That said, the only time I carried tools like these was when traveling for the better part of a year and even then, I bought the chef&rsquo;s knife and cheese grater at our first location of the trip.</p>
<p>If your trip is shorter, there&rsquo;s no reason to carry these things. However, you would be wise to carry a simple bag for groceries as it will come in handy at markets and at grocery stores. I&rsquo;ve visited several countries where it was common for grocery stores to charge for plastic bags and the majority of shoppers carried their own. This bag will come in handy for many other things as well so it&rsquo;s well worth bringing. I use mine on day trips and on the flight for the things I want with me in my seat. If you are traveling with companions, I&rsquo;d suggest bringing one of these bags per person. I find two bags useful when shopping at stores or markets.</p>
<p><em>Add photo for example</em></p>
<p>If you are taking trip for several months, some extra space in your backpack/luggage is useful for carrying perishables from one location to another. I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest you do this often but in a pinch, it is useful, especially if you have some leftover durable (not soft) vegetables and you&rsquo;re trying to be thrifty and not waste food. Normally I try to avoid this in favor of keeping my luggage light and to avoid damaging perishables but at times it can be helpful.</p>
