There are plenty of leftover meals, sides or supporting ingredients you can use in the morning to make a quick and easy breakfast. You can make a quick Spanish tortilla, a fritatta or an omelette - whatever suits you. As I prefer to be lazy and mix everything together, I'm usually making something more like a tortilla so I'll use that process below.

The base recipe is quite simple, whip up an egg or two then mix in the leftovers. Here are the important aspects to get right:

+ quantity of leftovers to eggs
+ cooking process
+ choose the right leftovers for your taste

All of these are easy to master with practice and experimentation.

Quantities are important because you don't want to mix too much leftover food with the eggs. These quantities will vary based on what you're mixing into the eggs. You have wiggle room.

Getting the process right isn't hard. Just try not to overcook the eggs. If you're going in the direction of a tortilla, keep the heat reasonably low so that you don't burn the bottom before the rest of the tortilla is done.

Choosing the right leftovers is really a matter of personal taste. Here are some leftovers I've used:

+ pesto (bottom left in above photo)
+ potatoes (ideally roasted/boiled but not mashed or not mashed too much)
+ stir fry (with or without rice)
+ peppers and onions (leftover from sausage dinner, bottom right in above photo)
+ lentil stew (strained the liquid out of it first, top left in above photo)
+ chili
+ broccoli and ham (top right in above photo, side of leftover roasted potatoes I then pan-fried)

## The Process

1. Whip an egg (or 2 or 3) in a bowl.
2. Add leftovers. Mix thoroughly.
3. Melt butter in a non-stick pan (or use olive oil).
4. Pour the mixture into the pan, cover and cook slowly over low heat.

Depending on how many eggs you use, you can flip the mixture on of several ways:

+ Toss/flip it with the pan
+ Use a spatula
+ Use a board or plate

To flip with a board/plate, cover the pan with a flat plate/cutting board, flip to remove the partially-cooked mixture and then slide it back into the pan with the uncooked side down (see the video to watch this).

If you used 2-3 eggs you'll likely need to flip with a board. Make sure you cook the mixture covered from the start so the top is likely to solidify a little so that when you flip the egg mixture out onto the board, it isn't too runny.

## Modifications

Beyond determining what leftovers to use, you can also add other elements to extend or enhance the tortilla. I have used:

+ ricotta cheese
+ cheddar cheese
+ buttermilk
+ leftover gravy from roast chicken dinner

Moderation is key here.
