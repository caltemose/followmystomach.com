## Before The Week

Went to the grocery store last Thursday so the fridge is pretty full. As we had a roasted chicken last week, we now have about a half-gallon of chicken broth I made on Saturday. Bought two chickens so still have one for a few meals this week plus additional broth to make.


## During the Week

**Sunday**: Made breadsticks with the standard recipe (yeast, flour, water salt) and I added some paprika to the dough which gave it some fun, streaky coloration. Also rolled the sticks in sesame seeds before baking. Pretty good - needed salt though (note to self: stop winging this measurement).

**Monday**: Used carrots/celery leftover from broth + some chopped cabbage + broth to make a soup base. Pur√©ed it and added leftover chopped chicken meat. Made a great lunch and made use of broth vegetables that might normally be wasted. Caneloni came out pretty good (better ricotta) and gave us lunch leftovers for my wife.

**Tuesday**: Lunch was leftover cleanup. During dinner prep, utchered whole chicken into parts for subsequent meals. Baked Japanese sweet potatoes - so good.

**Wednesday**: Strayed from the bibimbap recipe, which is usually fine, but without any particular goal/direction in mind. Came out fine but not great or unified flavors. 

**Thursday**: Bad day. Didn't care to make dinner so I ate some cut up raw vegetables. Didn't eat together with my wife.

**Friday**: A little bit better day although not much. Made fried chicken dinner from Thursday. Brightened up the day as it was quite good.

**Saturday**: Homemade pizza for lunch. Wasn't hungry at dinner so we both rummaged the fridge for leftovers/etc. 


## After The Week

The week started out on track, strayed a bit and ended well in terms of what I cooked and using leftovers and other bits to reduce waste. However, didn't meal plan on the weekend which isn't ideal so doing it Monday which is a bit late. Sometimes that's how it goes.
