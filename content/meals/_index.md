This section contains:

+ [A weekly log of our meals](weekly)
+ [Meal plans](plans) and articles to help you improve how you plan your meals

Meal planning is important for many reasons:

+ know what you're going to cook and buy ingredients appropriately
+ plan your meals to fit your schedule for the week
+ make your meals fit your health and diet needs
+ plan how you will sequence meals to make the best use of your pantry/fridge
+ de-clutter your brain with knowledge that is best put down on paper (or screen)

## Off On The Right Foot...

The most important thing for me to pass on is that the way to succeed here is to avoid overcomplicating these efforts. Make the process work for you.

In my case, I scratch out some notes on a scrap of paper and that's all I need. I document them here now for the purpose of sharing with you.

Another key fact you'll see from my plans is that I don't plan every single meal (usually). Each planned meal is a sign post to get me through the week and keep me on track. I leave room for improvisation on those days when I just don't feel like cooking or I feel like making something different. If you let the plans become rigid and you feel like you are following them blindly, you'll quickly stop making them.

## Key Parts to This Section
