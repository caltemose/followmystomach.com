## Before The Week

Planning a little late (Monday). 


## During the Week

**Sunday**: For dinner I made orecchiette with pork and tomato sauce (wife) as well as orecchiette with pork and broccoli raab (me - wife doesn't like raab). Good stuff. Ate way too much though because I love that dish so much. It always reminds me that pasta dishes without tomato sauce are way underappreciated in this country.
