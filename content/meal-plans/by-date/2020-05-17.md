## Before The Week

Grocery week. Starting to plan out long-term groceries so I know what I can get from farms and what I can start ordering to minimize trips to the grocery stores, which are no longer any fun in this covid climate.

## During the Week

**Sunday**: Nice trio of flatbreads for dinner with two vegetable sides. All were good but the final one with a bed of ricotta covered by the peppers, scallions and olives was the best.

**Monday**: Split pea soup came out fantastic. Cooked peas in water until there was little left (without burning peas) then added chicken broth to cover the peas. Pan-fried leek, celery and onion until lightly browned then added to soup while reserving some of the onions for the collards. Pan-fried two slices of bacon (chopped), reserved some of it for collards and added remainder plus some of the bacon fat into the soup. Simmered a bit longer. Soup came out perfect. Cooked collards with reserved onions and bacon and a bit of chicken stock. My wife said of the soup: "Fucking amazing."

**Tuesday**: Walked the beltline to the grocery store. Depressing as usual these days although I did get a whole chicken so...chin up. For breakfast I mixed 2 eggs with a scoop of ricotta plus leftover broccoli (chopped) and the remaining spinach pesto from the flatbreads a few days back. Made a wonderful tortilla/omelette. You could easily leave out the ricotta. Great way to reuse leftovers and remainders in the fridge.
