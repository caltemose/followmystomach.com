## Before The Week

I went to the grocery store last Thursday so the fridge is pretty full. As we had a roasted chicken last week, we now have about a half-gallon of chicken broth I made on Saturday. Bought two chickens so still have one for a few meals this week plus additional broth to make.

## During the Week

**Sunday**: Made breadsticks with the standard recipe (yeast, flour, water salt) and I added some paprika to the dough which gave it some fun, streaky coloration. Also rolled the sticks in sesame seeds before baking. Pretty good - needed salt though (note to self: stop winging this measurement).

**Monday**: Used carrots/celery leftover from broth + some chopped cabbage + broth to make a soup base. Pur√©ed it and added leftover chopped chicken meat. Made a great lunch and made use of broth vegetables that might normally be wasted. Caneloni came out pretty good (better ricotta) and gave us lunch leftovers for my wife.

## After The Week

Here is a summary of what happened, successes, failures, audibles.
