This page is about preparing for your trip abroad, specifically focusing on the cooking and food experience you want to have when traveling.

## Research and Motivation

You don't have to research before you leave but it can be helpful and motivating.

If you like to read about food culture, books like [this book on food in Italy](https://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Planet-World-Italy-Guides/dp/1864500220/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=food+italy+lonely+planet&qid=1590761290&s=books&sr=1-1) can be useful during long flights/transportation. Books/references focused on food culture can help give you context and history, helpful for getting deeper into your culinary adventures. If you can pick up a few of these you'll have something to do during your down time that helps enrich your experience. Save the physical books for reading at home and get some e-books for the trip to save on the weight.

Use your tv/stream viewing habits to help motivate you and give you ideas about what to eat and where to go. I'll presume you watch some food-related or travel-related shows â€“ use these to your advantage. Watch shows and keep a pen/mobile handy to take notes.

Online research is obviously helpful and you can find everything you need to help plan travel:

+ neighborhood descriptions
+ market and prominent food locations
+ food-related events and classes
+ recommendations for "where to get the best ___"

These media can help you learn about foreign food culture, dishes, markets and specialty ingredients. They can help you get ideas about where and when to go and what to cook.

## Apartment and Location Selection

All other things being equal, situate yourself near a great market. In Barcelona we stayed right next to La Boqueria, a famous and beautiful market. The riches of that market were worth the cost of being next to the main tourist thoroughfare. It was like La Boqueria was my pantry/fridge for a month.

When searching for an apartment online, pay attention to the kitchen. Don't expect it to be perfect but keep an eye out for kitchens that just won't work for you. If you see no photos of the kitchen in the online listing for the apartment, avoid it. If the kitchen has no counter space or looks like it was an afterthought crammed into a space that had no kitchen when originally built, you should probably avoid the apartment. The more you search for and rent apartments, the better you'll become at spotting the places that don't work for you after quickly viewing the apartment's photos online.

That "if they don't have photos of it, it's probably not acceptable" rule also applies to the bedroom and bathroom. If a listing has no photos of these rooms, I avoid it.

Sure there's no oven or microwave, but given what you're liking to be eating here, you won't miss those. What really makes this kitchen stand out is shown in the side photo - it has a big window with an unobstructed view of the Mediterranean.">}}

You shouldn't be able to reach your stove from your bed." >}}


## Tools & Packing

How you pack can have a huge impact on how much you enjoy your trip. Do not pack more than you need. Lighter luggage is always better. I cannot stress this enough.

{{<figure src="/img/travel/guide/getting-started/gear-2016-trip-1480.jpg" alt="Gear for 5-week trip" title="My gear for a 5-week trip" link="/img/travel/guide/getting-started/gear-2016-trip-1480.jpg" caption="This is the gear I packed for a 5-week trip to Italy. My grocery bag is that orange bag in the top left. The only gear not shown are my laptop and some toiletries." >}}

If you are taking a very long trip (several months or more), you may want to consider bringing a chef's knife. Rarely will you find suitable knives in rental apartments. That said, you're best off carrying no kitchen gear unless your trip is quite long.

The one thing I suggest bringing is useful in many ways: a simple bag for groceries will come in handy at markets, at grocery stores and in various other situations. I use mine on day trips and on the flight for the things I want with me in my seat. If you are traveling with companions, I'd suggest bringing one of these bags per person. I find two bags useful when shopping at stores or markets.

*Add photo for example*

If you are taking a trip for several months, some extra space in your backpack/luggage is useful for carrying perishables from one location to another. I wouldn't suggest you do this often but in a pinch, it is useful, especially if you have some leftover durable (not soft) vegetables and you're trying to be thrifty and not waste food. Normally I try to avoid this in favor of keeping my luggage light and to avoid damaging perishables but at times it can be helpful.
