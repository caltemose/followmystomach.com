If you're going to be traveling for a longer period, it's useful to have a list of core recipes you can use in travel kitchens. These recipes should me these criteria:

+ relatively easy to cook
+ you enjoy cooking and eating them
+ easy to find ingredients for
+ don't require special kitchen equipment you're unlikely to have when traveling

A lot of times I find these recipes are also comfort food for you. It's also useful if you have some or all of these recipes memorized. If these recipes are fairly simple, and some of them should be, you've probably already memorized them.

Given that you'll be going to foreign markets and grocery stores, it's also helpful if these recipes lend themselves to substitution of ingredients. 

## My Standard Traveling Recipes

Here are recipes I'm likely to make when traveling:

+ fritatta/spanish tortilla
+ simple pasta
+ salad with chicken

*(dig through photos/notes to find others)*

## Other Traveling Recipes

Here are some other recipes I suspect would fit this category well:

+ 1
+ 2
+ 3

## Recipes Explained

### Fritatta/Tortilla

This should have a link to a page with the recipe.

### Simple Pasta

No link needed here. Where can't you find pasta?

Non-tomato recipes (use whatever is local and in season).


### Salad with Chicken

Greens/cabbagge/etc with whatever plus roasted chicken leftovers.
