If you're going to be traveling for a longer period, it's useful to have a list of core recipes you can use in travel kitchens. These recipes should meet these criteria:

+ relatively easy to cook
+ you enjoy cooking and eating them
+ easy to find ingredients for
+ don't require special kitchen equipment

A lot of times I find these recipes are also comfort food for you. It's also useful if you have some or all of these recipes memorized. If these recipes are fairly simple, and some of them should be, you've probably already memorized them.

Given that you'll be going to foreign markets and grocery stores, it's also helpful if these recipes lend themselves to substitution of ingredients.

## My Standard Traveling Recipes

Here are recipes I'm likely to make when traveling:

{{<figure src="/img/travel/guide/standard-recipes/aix-egg-tart-1480.jpg" link="/img/travel/guide/standard-recipes/aix-egg-tart-1480.jpg" alt="Egg Tart in Aix" title="Egg Tart in Aix" caption="Whether it's a tart, an omelette, a frittata, a spanish tortilla, or Korean pajeon, you can make a great egg dish anywhere there are great eggs." >}}

{{<figure src="/img/travel/guide/standard-recipes/aix-pasta-1480.jpg" link="/img/travel/guide/standard-recipes/aix-pasta-1480.jpg" alt="Pasta in Aix-en-Provence" title="Pasta with pork and broccoli" caption="This is fresh pasta but I'm normally making dry pasta when traveling to keep things easy. Either way, keep an eye out for the best local specialties to pair with pasta, whether its mushrooms, asparagus, shrimp or wild boar.">}}

{{<figure src="/img/travel/guide/standard-recipes/san-sebastian-chicken-salad-1480.jpg" link="/img/travel/guide/standard-recipes/san-sebastian-chicken-salad-1480.jpg" alt="Salad with Chicken in Aix-en-Provence" title="Salad with Chicken" caption="This could easily be Salad with *whatever great things you find at the market*. As long as lettuce or other greens are in season, you can make a salad. And you can always supplement it with a second dish so you aren't hungry an hour later.">}}

Those three go pretty far given the many ways you can make any of those dishes. Pick any good market you're likely to visit and you will find ingredients to make a great egg dish or a great pasta dish or a great salad. 

If those don't work for you, make your own substitutions:

+ rice dishes
+ soups
+ tacos

Pick whatever works for you and keeps your belly happy.
