Many of us have an interest in foreign food culture. When you go out to eat while traveling you experience a part of this food culture and work on building your understanding of that culture. 

For many of us, cooking at our temporary home when traveling isn't something we naturally think of to build foreign food culture knowledge. I have gotten a lot of learning and joy out of cooking in foreign apartments and I've made plenty of mistakes. I've put much of what I've learned into this guide to help others get the most out of cooking and eating when traveling.

<!-- Because I've stayed in many apartments internationally, and visited a ton of grocery stores and markets, I've built up a solid knowledge base around the processes surrounding travel cooking.  -->

## Barriers to Cooking Abroad

There are two main barriers to cooking abroad:

1. not having a kitchen
2. not having the time to cook

If you cannot remove these barriers, it's unlikely you'll find this guide useful.

The first barrier can be removed by staying in apartments rather than hotels. With sites like AirBnB, finding an apartment can be a fun part of preparing for your travel. When searching for apartments remember to look for a reasonable kitchen and proximity to good markets. If the listing has no photos of the kitchen, or the kitchen appears to be lacking in critical features (space, stove, refrigerator) then avoid it.

The second barrier can be a bit more difficult to remove. If you only stay in places for a few days when you travel, you will find it nearly impossible to cook when traveling. My experience has taught me that I need to stay in place for about two weeks to get the most out of cooking locally in a city. A week is possible but tricky depending on where you're staying if you find the local restaurant scene distracting.

This duration of stay barrier to cooking abroad is often difficult to remove since it requires an adjustment to your thinking about travel and your planning.
