This page is about shopping for groceries when traveling, specifically using grocery stores and super markets as opposed to street/farmers' markets.

## Grocery Store Tips

+ Visit several to see what they offer
+ Learn/note their hours
+ Use them to break bigger bills (sparingly)
+ Bring your own bag(s), not everywhere provides them
+ Get your cheap stuff here

*Add some stories*

*Add a list of what I normally buy here*

## Other Food Shops

+ Check the prepared foods, some can be amazing
+ Look for friendly merchants and ask them advice and suggestions (people love to give advice)
+ If you find a good proprietor, let them guide you, especially after you've vetted the place and determined they aren't just trying to take your money

## Specialty Foods

You could also call these focused food shops: shops specializing in a single thing like meat, fish, cheese, bread, pastries, wine, etc.

You can find some really interesting items here and more diversity than you are likely to find at a supermarket.

If you find great proprietors, ask them to give you a tour of their ingredients if they aren't busy.
