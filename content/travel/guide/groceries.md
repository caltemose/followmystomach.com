This page is about shopping for groceries when traveling, specifically using grocery stores and super markets as opposed to street/farmers' markets.

## Grocery Store Tips

+ Visit several to see what they offer
+ Learn/note their hours
+ Use them to break bigger bills (sparingly)
+ Bring your own bag(s), not everywhere provides them
+ Get your cheap stuff here

Most importantly, don't presume people at the grocery store speak your language.

Pay attention to the locals to learn any local grocery store etiquette. Specifically watch out people interact with someone behind a counter (deli, bakery, etc); watch how people line up to checkout, watch how they pay and how groceries are bagged. If you have to weigh your own produce, pay attention to how locals do that. All this stuff seems simple but being aware of minor cultural differences will help your experience be calmer.

Even though the daily items in a foreign super market will be ordinary/trivial to the locals, I find myself frequently excited by some of those mundane items. Be on the lookout for gems and experiment, you never know until you try something.

The best rice pudding I've ever had came from a grocery store. The label said "as good as your grandmother's" to which I kept responding, "no, it's better."

## Other Food Shops

Compared to the U.S., many other countries have a larger variety of specialty food shops that are required visiting. This is frequently where you'll find local, artisenal products (sorry for all the buzzwords) that you really want to try. The best of these shops usually focus on something specific such as butchery, bakery, wines, etc.

You're looking to stumble across something unexpected and wonderful:

+ Check the prepared foods (e.g. seafood salad), some can be amazing
+ Look for friendly merchants and ask them for advice and suggestions (people love to give advice when it's convenient)
+ If you find a good proprietor, let them guide you
+ If you walk into a shop and it smells like heaven, don't leave empty handed. 

You can find some really interesting items here and more diversity than you are likely to find at a supermarket.

This is pure heaven and unless you're allergic to dairy, you need to be tasting things at places like this.">}}

If you find great proprietors, ask them to give you a tour of their ingredients if they aren't busy.
