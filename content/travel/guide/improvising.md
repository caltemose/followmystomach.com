Working in a temporary kitchen can be fun but it's often a bit of work and requires some thinking when you plan recipes and buy ingredients. You probably won't have access to a fully-stocked kitchen. How a kitchen is stocked can be a great limiter on what you can cook but if you approach it with the right attitude, you can use these limitations to your advantage.

## Keep it Simple

You've already got enough variables being in a foreign kitchen, don't make things worse by trying complex recipes or preparations in a kitchen not suited to those tasks. Make recipes you have a high chance of completing successfully.

## Obvious Stuff

If you need an apron while cooking, you can improvise one with a bath towel tied around your waist. 

Most apartments don't have much in the way of storage for leftovers so keep the useful empty containers from items you purchased at the market or grocer. They will come in handy again.

Don't force the improvisation. I've used a bottle to roll pasta on enough occasions to know it's just not worth the effort. Some things can wait til you go home. You're on vacation, don't make things difficult on yourself.
