Working in a temporary kitchen can be fun but it's often a bit of work and requires some thinking when you plan recipes and buy ingredients. It's very likely you will not have access to a fully-stocked kitchen. How a kitchen is stocked can be a great limiter on what you can cook since it's possible you won't have an oven or may have only one stove burner or will have a very small refrigerator.

One thing you may want to carry with you if you plan to do a lot of cooking and already spend a lot of time in the kitchen is a good chef's knife. Do not expect to find good knives in any rental apartment. Just be aware of the ramifications of carrying a knife (no carry-on).
