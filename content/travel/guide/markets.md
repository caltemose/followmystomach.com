This page is about exploring and taking advantage of foreign markets, specifically the daily or weekly markets that take over a plaza or other open space and offer the most variety of fresh ingredients you are likely to find. Like this one:

## Market Prep Work

First off, learn about the main local markets before you arrive. Document their schedules so you don't accidentally miss a market because you got the day wrong. Plenty of markets, especially outside big cities, are only open 1-2 days a week. I've stayed in places for just a week and missed the main market because I didn't do my homework to find out the day the market opens.

## What's Better About These Markets?

When you find the right market, it will likely be the cheapest place to get produce and it will be the best quality produce you can find in season and if you're lucky, it will be staffed by pleasant vendors who want to share their bounties with you. That's the ideal situation. Plenty of markets aren't quite this ideal but are still fantastic places to buy your groceries and explore local food culture.

## Learn the Market

Before you dive right in to making purchases, take a walk around the market and pay attention to how vendors and buyers behave. You want to make sure you learn the basic market etiquette so you can fit right in like a local. Pay attention to:

+ whether or not buyers touch the produce
+ what vendors have a crowd
+ what customers are buying the most of or aren't buying at all
+ whether or not vendors accept credit cards (they usually don't)

Smooth transactions with the vendors enhance your market experience so pay attention to market interactions and follow market etiquette to get on the good side of the vendors. Make them your friends and you'll have an excellent market experience. Ignore market etiquette and you'll not have a good experience.


## Meet the Vendors

On my initial tour of a market I'll note which vendors appeal to me most and then stop by each one to ask questions and make purchases. Remember that as customer, you are there to get the best possible versions of the best items at the market.

When you walk up to a vendor, you make an assessment of how helpful/how patient you think that vendor will be. You want to be able to determine if this vendor has the interest and time to tell you about what she or he is selling. Normally you'll have a quick interaction but when you sense the opportunity to get a vendor to open up, take advantage of that opportunity. And if you sense the vendor isn't going to be helpful or is going to try to get you to buy his difficult items, move on. 

Your assumption at each vendor should be that as the current customer, you deserve the best of whatever that vendor has to offer. And the customer after you deserves the second best of that vendor's goods. And so on. 

## Explore and Experiment

Whenever I buy produce abroad I'm always comparing it to what I can get at home. I want to taste/feel how it differs, if at all. Sometimes the version I find abroad is just so much better and other times it is not. Sometimes it's just different.

You've heard about tomatoes in Italy or cheese in France - now's your chance to do the taste test yourself.

After this trip you may never find yourself back at this market so if you see something that might be tasty, taste it. Explore the exotic ingredients of other places.

Even if you know how to cook an ingredient, ask the vendor how they suggest cooking the ingredient. A passionate vendor will take time to explain how to get the most out of an ingredient.

## Don't Go Overboard

It's easy to get excited when a knowledgable vendor takes time to tell you about his or her produce, and it's easy to buy more than you were expecting. Don't go crazy and end up having to throw stuff away at the end of your trip.
