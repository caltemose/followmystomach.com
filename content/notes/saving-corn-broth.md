If i'm having corn on the cob, it's likely I'm boiling it. It's simple to prepare, I don't have to babysit it, and the corn takes on the flavor of whatever I put in the water.

I used to just through that water away when the corn was done. Now I usually don't if the water has been flavored sufficiently.

You can reuse this broth in so many ways and not only save money but get the most out of the spices and other things you're using to give flavor to the corn you're boiling. As a plus, if you're reserving this broth, you can be as aggressive with the spices as you want because you aren't just tossing them after the corn is done. This way you get the flavor you want, you save money, reduce waste and let's face it, most broth sold in the store is over-priced and doesn't taste great. Yeah, that's my opinion but I know plenty of you agree. And if you're buying industrial/big food broth, who knows what's in that? 

## Cooking the Corn and Making the Broth

As you can see in this photo, I've added spices to the water to give the corn flavor. In this case I've aggressively flavored the water with:

+ cumin seeds
+ celery seeds
+ fennel seeds
+ paprika powder

Once the corn is done and removed, save the broth. Here's mine:

Not only is this broth flavored with the spices above but it also takes on the corn flavor and a little starch. Stick the broth in the fridge and use it later.

## Using the Flavored Corn Broth

Once you have this you can use it in the same way you'd use a vegetable or animal-based broth. I'll use it in these manners:

- as the broth for paella or risotto (or any rice dish really)
- as the broth for polenta
- to deglaze whatever you're cooking in a saut√©e pan (brussel sprouts, cauliflower and many other vegetables)

You could add it to a stew or soup you're making instead of adding water when the recipe calls for it.

Here's what I've made recently using this technique:
