Save your melted butter and flavor it with seeds, herbs, and/or spices for an excellent flavored butter you can reuse later.

I'm sure you've seen recipes for making various flavored butters with chive or honey or a few other herbs. You can get pretty creative with this and save all sorts of extra bits from recipes you've made and reuse the butter/lipids you've reserved from previous meals.

I recently roasted some sesame seeds for a recipe and had about a tablespoon leftover. The next day, I made a dish where I saut√©ed some mushrooms in olive oil and butter. Once I'd removed the mushrooms from the pan I realized there was a good bit of oil/butter mixture leftover in the pan. I saw the little cup of roasted sesame seeds I'd made the day before and poured the oil/butter mixture into the cup. I stuck the cup into the fridge and let it solidify. 

And that's it - I took what might have gone into the trash and made a small amount of flavored butter. A few days later I spread that flavored butter mix over some fresh bread I'd baked. So good.

You might think "why would I save the used butter and oil from something I just cooked since it's been affected by the heat?"

Sure - maybe it sounds weird. Maybe it is weird. I can tell you it was really good on that bread though.

Go get adventurous and see what you come up with.
