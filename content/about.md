## Why am I Doing This?

I started this site to share how I approach cooking. But more specifically, to help people cook more, cook more efficiently, plan meals better, enjoy cooking and eating and be healthy (according to their own definition of that term). I also want to help people sequence their meals smartly to make cooking easier and waste less food.

Additionally, I really enjoy cooking when traveling for a lot of reasons. I'd like to share that passion with you along with some tips for how to succeed when travel cooking in the hopes that some of you will adjust how you eat when traveling to have deeper experiences in food cultures around the world. Cooking when traveling has taught me a great deal that I can then bring home to enhance how I cook at home.

## Why are You Viewing This?

I'm trying to cater to the following kinds of people:

+ people who like to cook but have trouble staying on track
+ people who want to reduce how much food they waste
+ people who want to improve their cooking
+ people who want a deeper experience from foreign food cultures
+ people who want to improve their health with more effective meal plans

## How Did I Get This Way?

I'm lucky - my mother is Italian-American and I grew up with home-cooked meals almost every day. We ate out for special occasions or when traveling. This made me habituated to eating home-cooked meals. I spent holidays in the kitchen with my mother and other relatives. My uncle worked at an Italian butcher/deli. It just seemed natural to want to help out in the kitchen.

And so, like many of you, I find myself in the kitchen all the time.

The travel part came from frequent traveling as a child. We moved a lot because my father was in the military. After I left the nest, I traveled on my own and later with my wife. With my wife I learned to travel slowly - staying in a single location for a longer time rather than bouncing around. Back in 2009 we learned that we love staying in a place for a month. These things led me to staying in apartments and cooking when traveling - partially because eating out every day is exhausting and expensive, but mostly because I love visiting foreign grocers and markets and seeing what I can make with what I buy.

For pedigree (so to speak), here are places we've stayed for two weeks or more (in one visit) during the past decade:

+ Barcelona (5 weeks)
+ Lisbon (4 weeks)
+ San Sebastian (Spain, 2 weeks)
+ Aix-en-Provence (3 weeks)
+ Cinque Terre (Italy, 3 weeks)
+ Milan (2 weeks)
+ Paris (5 weeks)
+ Chieti province (Italy, 2 weeks)
